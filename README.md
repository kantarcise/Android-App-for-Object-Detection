# Android-App-for-Object-Detection
This project is about develop an application using OpenCV &amp; Neural Networks with object detection goal in mind.

## Getting Started

Well, the project already started with a basic version off the app made. Which is just an .apk that uses the camera, and with its one button, when pressed; processes the frames using (yolov3-tiny).[https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/] 

Now we are trying to achieve, fullscreen without breaking anything.

After we are gonna be trying to use the camera at 720p 30fps.

Maybe somewhere on the line we will try to get the yolo results to a txt.
